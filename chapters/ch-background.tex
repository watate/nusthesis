\section{Deep Reinforcement Learning}

Deep reinforcement learning is the combination of reinforcement learning and deep learning. This idea of using neural networks for reinforcement learning, however, is not new and can be dated all the way back to Teasauro's TD-Gammon~\cite{tesauro_temporal_nodate}. In the early 2010s, however, the field of deep learning began to find groundbreaking success, particularly in speech recognition~\cite{dahl_context-dependent_2012} and computer vision~\cite{krizhevsky_imagenet_2017}. This success, combined with the advances in computing power (which drastically reduced training time), allowed the revival in interest of using deep neural networks as universal function approximators for reinforcement learning - leading to deep reinforcement learning.
