\section{Brief Description of Project}

This work presents a case study of a learning-based approach to smoothing the movement of a real robotic platform. The robotic platform is operated by an end-to-end neural network which is trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to perform target driven map-less navigation. Previous works~\cite{pfeiffer_reinforced_2018},~\cite{tai_virtual--real_2017},~\cite{xie_learning_2018} have focused more on improving the path-finding or trajectory-generating aspect of map-less navigation while this work focuses on the motion profile planning of map-less navigation. That is, the main idea of this work is to show that smoothing the motion profile generated by the DRL model can be achieved through a learning-based approach. A smooth motion profile is taken here to mean a motion profile that minimizes jerk (time derivative of acceleration).
