I would like to thank my parents, Tay Boon Chit and Lim Swee Yin, whom without I would not have been in NUS. I thank my brother, David Tay Ang Shun, who has been supportive of me in many ways. I thank all my friends in Cinnamon College and in the Mechanical Engineering Department, who have made my undergraduate life a rich and fulfilling one.
