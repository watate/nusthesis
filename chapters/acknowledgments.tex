All of the work described in this thesis was done under the supervision of my advisor, Dr. Zhang Yunfeng. I would like to thank him for giving me the flexibility of exploring my thesis in a different direction, which allowed me to make many useful insights and connections in the field of deep reinforcement learning.

I'd also like to thank Zhang Wei, who helped guide my learning process and gave insightful answers to the problems that I had. The work on a learning-based approach to motion profile smoothing grew out of discussions with my friends from computer science, He Yuchen and Khaw Yew Onn. Thanks to Raivat Shah for collaborating with me on projects not included in this thesis document, which helped develop my understanding of deep learning. I am also immensely grateful to Eddie Lim Jia Lok, who helped design the illustrations for the neural network architectures featured in this thesis.

I would like to thank my parents, Tay Boon Chit and Lim Swee Yin, whom without I would not have been in NUS. I thank my brother, David Tay Ang Shun, who has been supportive of me in many ways. I thank all my friends in Cinnamon College and in the Mechanical Engineering Department, who have made my undergraduate life a rich and fulfilling one.
