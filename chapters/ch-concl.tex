\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we proposed an approach to smoothing the motion profile of a robot without explicitly coding for the motion profile (i.e. through a learning-based approach)....

While our method does improve the smoothness of the motion profile of the robot, it does have a number of limitations. First,... 

By enabling smooth map-less navigation without user-programmed motion profiles, we believe that our approach represents a small step towards making reinforcement learning a practical, automated, and readily usable tool in this area.
